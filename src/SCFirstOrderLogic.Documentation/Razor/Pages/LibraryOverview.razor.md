# Library Overview

Here is a quick overview of the namespaces found within the SCFirstOrderLogic library. Reading this should give you some helpful context for diving a little deeper:

* **`SCFirstOrderLogic`:** the root namespace contains classes representing individual elements of first order logic sentences (universal and existential quantifications, conjunctions, disjunctions, predicates, functions and so on).
  Instances of these classes are composed into tree structures that represent sentences of first order logic.
  This namespace also contains classes that represent sentences in [conjunctive normal form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctive_normal_form), as well as one that represents the identifier of a well-known predicate - equality.
  * **`ClauseIndexing`:** clause indexing data structures, for fast lookup of stored clauses that subsume or are subsumed by a query clause.
    Specifically, there are feature vector index implementations in here.
    Customisation of the backing store is allowed for via an abstraction for tree nodes, and both synchronous and asynchronous versions exist.
  * **`Inference`:** intended as the top-level namespace for actual inference algorithms. Contains `IKnowledgeBase`, an interface for knowledge bases (stores of knowledge that callers can `Tell` and `Ask` things).
    No implementations are included in the core library.
  * **`LanguageIntegration`:** contains classes to create FoL sentences from LINQ expressions (i.e. allowing sentences to be provided as lambda expressions).
    See [here](beyond-getting-started/language-integration.md) for details.
  * **`SentenceCreation`:** logic to ease the creation of sentences (which the `LanguageIntegration` classes - see above - serve as an alternative to).
  * **`SentenceFormatting`:** logic for creating string representations of sentences. Includes logic for ensuring unique labelling of e.g. standardised variables and Skolem functions across a set of sentences.
  * **`SentenceManipulation`:** Contains some interfaces and base classes for the manipulation of sentences - sentence visitors and transformations.
    * **`Normalisation`:** sentence manipulation & interrogation logic related to normalisation. For example; transformation to CNF, and restandardisation of variables in a sentence already in CNF.
    * **`VariableManipulation`:** sentence manipulation & interrogation logic for working with variables. For example; a variable substitution representation, as well as logic for identifying generalisations, instances, unifications, subsumed clauses etc.
  * **`TermIndexing`:** term indexing data structures, for fast lookup of generalisations and instances of query terms. 
    There are discrimination tree and path tree implementations in here.
    Customisation of the backing store is allowed for via an abstraction for tree nodes, and both synchronous and asynchronous versions exist.

For a full type and member listing, the recommendation is to use the [FuGet package explorer](https://www.fuget.org/packages/SCFirstOrderLogic/) - though going through [getting started](getting-started.md) first is probably a good idea, if you haven't already.
