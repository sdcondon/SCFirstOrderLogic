Since you are here, you might also be interested in some of the following.

Books & Papers:
* (Chapters 8 and 9 of) [Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach" (Russell & Norvig)](https://www.google.com/search?q=isbn+978-1292153964).
* [Simple and Efficient Clause Subsumption with Feature Vector Indexing](https://wwwlehre.dhbw-stuttgart.de/~sschulz/PAPERS/Schulz2013-FVI.pdf)
 
Other 'SC..' AI libraries:
* [SCClassicalPlanning](https://sdcondon.net/SCClassicalPlanning): Basic classical planning implementations. Based on chapter 10 of "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach" - though perhaps a _little_ more loosely than this package is based on chapters 8 and 9. Specifically, introduces a couple more PDDL concepts that the book doesn't bother with (but should IMO). Depends on this library (and [SCGraphTheory.Search](https://github.com/sdcondon/SCGraphTheory.Search)).
* [SCPropositionalLogic](https://github.com/sdcondon/SCPropositionalLogic): Basic propositional logic implementations. Based on chapter 7 of "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach". Mostly just a precursor to this package - I haven't bothered publishing this one to NuGet - but some may find it interesting, if not useful.

A selection of other AI-related libraries:
* [Infer.NET](https://dotnet.github.io/infer/): Bayesian inference engine. Bayesian logic of course being strictly more powerful than first-order logic.
* [AIMA Code - C#](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-csharp): I mention this only because I feel like I should. This is the "official" C# repository for "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach" - and it is.. err.. not great.
